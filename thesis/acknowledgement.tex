I would like to thank my friend Blumenschein Volfram for helping me in checking my work for grammatical errors. 

I would also like to thank Stephen Jackson for his tutorial, which helped me to understand the basic idea of LALR parser construction algorithm - he tried to make the subject easy to understand, and I think he succeeded.
